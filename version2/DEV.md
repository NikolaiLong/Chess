#### Disclaimer:
All coordinates in code are in (x,y) i.e. (column,row) format - then are transformed when printed

#### Current To Do:
* update all libraries
* plan out ML library progressions
* connect database

#### Updates Coming Soon:
* log file upload to resume a position
* Executable file to play chess
* Medium and large chess board sizes (default is currently XL)
* NN advancement - computer is currently non existent
